    <h1>Inferred Equivalence</h1>

    Equivalence was inferred from equality.
    I.e. both resources are identical, and can therefore be assumed to be equivalent.
    Equivalence here means that running "javap -c -p" on the respective class files will produce the same output.
    This feature is used to avoid the expensive computation of equivalence.
